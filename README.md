Driver for TI's ADS1X15: 12 and 16-bit Differential or Single-Ended ADC with PGA and Comparator

## Info

This family of ADCs provide 4 single-ended or 2 differential channels.
Each has a programmable gain amplifier from 2/3 up to 16x. Available
in 12 or 16 bit versions:

* [ADS1015 12-bit ADC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1083)
* [ADS1115 16-bit ADC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085)

The chip's fairly small so it comes on a breakout board with ferrites to keep the AVDD and AGND quiet. Interfacing is done via I2C.
 The address can be changed to one of four options (see the datasheet table 5) 
so you can have up to 4 ADS1x15's connected on a single 2-wire I2C bus for 16 single ended inputs.

*Configure all single-ended analog pin and calculation of voltage for each individual ADC .....

Thank You'
